NEWS for libstroke-0.5

  The big NEWS is that LibStroke now can draw the strokes! Yeeepeeee!
  But it does not do so by default, you need to pass --with-mouse-footprints
  to ./configure. After compiling everything try tests/stroke_test to
  see how this works. 
  
  There's even more: libgstroke, a stroke implementation for GNOME has
  been contributed by Dan Nicolaescu. It is fully functional (it
  also supports mouse footprints by default!) and has a very easy to
  use API. Try tests/gnome_stroke_test to see how it works (source
  code in tests/gnome_stroke_test.c). 

  We are proposing a set of strokes to be standard strokes. A pretty
  picture with them their string representation can be found in 
  doc/standard_strokes.jpg 
  A text listing is in doc/standard_strokes.txt (we will find some
  better names than the current ones). 
  We'll also add some "sloppy strokes" for the standard strokes.

  We created autoconf macros for libstroke and libgstroke, they are in
  the macros subdir. 

NEWS for libstroke-0.4

Thu Mar 16 01:18:07 PST 2000
  Hoo, I have not been making entries in this file.  The news tonight is
  that I am releasing 0.4.  It has a super-cool Java port included and some
  misc bug fixes with the install process.  Also, cool news is that there is
  now support for LibStroke in FVWM2, gEDA, and PCB.  See the CREDITS file
  for the authors that made this possible.

  I am also thinking of hosting the project on sourceforge.net and using
  their resources for making the project more accessible.
