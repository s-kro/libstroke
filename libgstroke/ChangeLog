	* Rename everything to be called gstroke* instead of stroke* as
	the later is sometimes used to mean other things in GNOME
	programs. 

2000-08-25  Dan Nicolaescu  <dann@ics.uci.edu>

	* gnome-stroke.c: Move global data to a structure...
	* stroke-internal.h: ... defined here (struct stroke_metrics).
	(STROKE_METRICS): New define.

	* gnome-stroke.c (stroke_init): 
	(stroke_trans): Take a stroke_metrics* parameter.  
	
	(stroke_trans):	Call stroke_init instead of freeing the
	pointList. 
	
	* stroke.h (STROKE_MOUSE_BUTTON): New define.
	* gnome-stroke-wrapper.c (process_event): Use it.
	(stroke_execute): Make it static.
	(STROKE_SIGNALS): New define.
	(stroke_signal_connect): 
	(stroke_execute): Use it instead of a string. 
	(stroke_cleanup): New function. Should be called when the widget
	is destroyed. 
	(stroke_canonical): Move it after stroke_trans so gcc can inline
	it. 

	Prepend _ to all the non-static functions to keep the namespace
	clean.
