fix autoconfig stuff to actually find the gtk headers and only build gnome
version of library if gnome is detected.

in general, grokking and redo of autoconf

General things I have planned to do:
   make trailing XOR line/erase line
   make the home page prettier
   move development to sourceforge.net
   add an FVWM module to display the stroke bindings (ie, a 'help' function)
   write/test the C++,Perl, bindings or translations
   make a GNOMEified version of the library, get it in glibc
   write a GNOME control app for configuring strokes in GNOME

Bug list:

This may still be outstanding, I dunno:
